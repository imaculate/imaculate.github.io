      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself thinking a lot about Nakia lately, thanks to free stickers I got at a work event. Of all the options, I naturally gravitated to the strong female characters. Shuri and Okoye were easy picks since I aspire to be smart as the former and as strong as the latter, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so sure about Nakia.
There is obvious merit to her character; in addition to saving Wakanda on multiple occasions, she is constantly striving it to help the rest of the world that is largely neglected.</description>
