A lot of wake up calls happen at the doctor&amp;rsquo;s offce. All too often we hear about how bad news changed the trajectory of one&amp;rsquo;s life: death, terminal illness, cautionary test results you name it. This call is ussually followed by a resolve to live healthier lives, likely active but definitely fuller lives. I recently had one such call, except my doctor didn&amp;rsquo;t deliver bad news, nor did they bring particularly good news, they simply confirmed that everything was fine, there was nothing wrong in any of the standard annual exams.</description>

      <description>My, what a year! For the first time I&amp;rsquo;m looking back at a year ago and I feel &amp;hellip; different, some degree stronger, some degree wiser, a lot more focused, and ofcourse very different. While the global review of 2020 deserves a series of encyclopedias, this post is about my personal review.
Work&amp;nbsp;Â¶I switched to a new team at Microsoft in the first week of March; the very definition of bad timing.</description>
