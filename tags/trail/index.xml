      <title>Trail Year</title>

      <description>A year ago I did my first trail run and wrote my first trail inspired post. Little did I know of the adventures that were about to unfold. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve not only ran my longest distance in one day (50 miles), I&amp;rsquo;ve also grown comfortable running ultras. I think that&amp;rsquo;s wild considering that the half marathon used to be my stretch distance. On reflecting on the wild year, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some lessons I learnt.</description>

      <description>Fun fact about me, I have terrible sense of direction. Whenever I go someplace new, I budget for at least 15 minutes of getting lost. It happens so often that getting it right the first feels unnatural. A few highlights include the time I lost the bike trail and ended up biking on the highway (!!Do not try this at home!!), the one time I got lost kayaking on a lake (yes, that is possible), the time I spent finding my way in Osaka which was 100% of the time.</description>
