      <description>Fun fact about me, I have terrible sense of direction. Whenever I go someplace new, I budget for at least 15 minutes of getting lost. It happens so often that getting it right the first feels unnatural. A few highlights include the time I lost the bike trail and ended up biking on the highway (!!Do not try this at home!!), the one time I got lost kayaking on a lake (yes, that is possible), the time I spent finding my way in Osaka which was 100% of the time.</description>
