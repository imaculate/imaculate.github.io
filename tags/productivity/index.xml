      <description>When I first heard of the term SOS run from my run club, I thought it was a type of a fast run powered by adrenaline with some sort of simulated danger like sprinters in bear costume. As wild as my imagination was, I was partly right, a SOS run is indeed fast but there are no bears or costumes involved at least not planned. So what exactly is an SOS run?</description>
