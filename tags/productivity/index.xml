I aspire to be one of those people who leave this planet without a stone left unturned. No, I have no desire to live a painfully long life nor do I dream of immortality.

      <description>When I first heard of the term SOS run from my run club, I thought it was a type of a fast run powered by adrenaline with some sort of simulated danger like sprinters in bear costume.
