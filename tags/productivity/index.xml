Lets talk about this time-series whose trend is as predictable as the S&amp;amp;P 500. Whatever it is, it has been consistently trending upwards and chances are, that won&amp;rsquo;t change anytime soon. What you&amp;rsquo;re looking at is global interest in the word productive for as long as we&amp;rsquo;ve had data. Turns out productivity is top of mind whether we are in a recession or a global pandemic.</description>

      <description>When I first heard of the term SOS run from my run club, I thought it was a type of a fast run powered by adrenaline with some sort of simulated danger like sprinters in bear costume. As wild as my imagination was, I was partly right, a SOS run is indeed fast but there are no bears or costumes involved at least not planned. So what exactly is an SOS run?</description>
