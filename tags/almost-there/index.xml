      <description>&amp;ldquo;Almost there&amp;rdquo;; sometimes these are the words of comfort I need to hear and sometimes they make want to attack the utterer. Being a runner and hiker means I get to hear them a lot more often than I want to. I love the intent behind them, they mean well. When I&amp;rsquo;m near the finish line, I welcome all variations of &amp;ldquo;Almost there&amp;rdquo; because its true, I can see the finish line and any form of discomfort I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing is bound to be over soon.</description>
