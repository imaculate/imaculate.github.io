      <description>I love quotable quotes. A good quote sparks my imagination, it makes me conjure up circumstances that prompted it. Take this example:
Enjoy the little things in life because one day you`ll look back and realize they were the big things. - Robert Brault
I wonder if Robert Brault was sitting by the beach, looking back at the last 5 years when he realized all the big things didn&amp;rsquo;t matter as much as he thought they would.</description>
