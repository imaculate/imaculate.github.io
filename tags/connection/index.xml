      <description>I recently came across this video of a penguin, call him Walker, committing suicide by running away from it all; the colony, the ocean, sustenance and everything that is essential for survival. On the surface, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, penguins are among the social creatures on earth. If nothing else, he should have wanted to stay in the colony. We can&amp;rsquo;t know for sure what was happening in his mind but we can make educated guesses.</description>
