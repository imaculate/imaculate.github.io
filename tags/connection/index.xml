      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself thinking a lot about Nakia lately, thanks to free stickers I got at a work event. Of all the options, I naturally gravitated to the strong female characters. Shuri and Okoye were easy picks since I aspire to be smart as the former and as strong as the latter, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t so sure about Nakia.
There is obvious merit to her character; in addition to saving Wakanda on multiple occasions, she is constantly striving it to help the rest of the world that is largely neglected.</description>

      <description>I recently came across this video of a penguin, call him Walker, committing suicide by running away from it all; the colony, the ocean, sustenance and everything that is essential for survival. On the surface, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make any sense, penguins are among the social creatures on earth. If nothing else, he should have wanted to stay in the colony. We can&amp;rsquo;t know for sure what was happening in his mind but we can make educated guesses.</description>
