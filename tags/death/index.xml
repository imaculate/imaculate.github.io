      <description>This post was supposed to be about tips to crush New Years Resolutions. I wanted to share pointers like one of those people who have life figured out. It took less than 2 weeks to be reminded of my own fragility, impermanence and imperfection. Inspite of marginal success I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m still a work in progress, we all are. If you want tips on making and actualizing your resolutions, Google Is Your Friend.</description>

      <description>Trigger Warning: grief, death
Inhale, exhale, Inhale, Exhale .. a dozen times a minute and thats enough to keep you oxygenated to do all the amazing things you are capable of. If you pause to listen you&amp;rsquo;ll hear the sound of wind, rhythmically blowing in and out of your lungs like clockwork; the original soundtrack to your life. Ideally you want that soundtrack to go on forever, we all do. However we want it, the events of last year have made it clear how much life our lives hinges on that soundtrack and how delicate it really is.</description>
