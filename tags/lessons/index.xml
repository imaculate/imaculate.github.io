      <description>Meet Imaculate the business-woman.
You are probably wondering, how did we get here? Did I quit my tech job? What happened to the running-inspired articles? Thanks for asking; No I&amp;rsquo;m still a Software Engineer who runs a lot. I just added another line to my resume. If you stick around, you&amp;rsquo;ll find out that this venture was very much inspired by running. You are probably why? The answer lies somewhere in curiosity, fun and obsession.</description>
