      <description>A few weeks ago I ran my first 100K, the Badger Mountain 100K challenge. I crossed the finish line after 16 hours making it my furthest and longest effort, ever. I could give you a thousand reasons why it was a good idea to run the race: fitness, challenge, adventure &amp;hellip; among many others. They&amp;rsquo;d all be valid but the real value I got from it was the fact that it was on my calendar; neatly partitioning it into a before and after era.</description>

I often get asked how I come up with my articles, if at all there is a formula behind this self-inflicted obligation to overshare what I overthink. Well, yes, its more of a process. At the end of the week, ussually on a long run or bike ride, I like to do a post-mortem reflecting on events of the week. Anything that repeatedly stands out makes it to this page.</description>
