      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time user of Future Me, a service that lets you send emails to the future. At the chosen date, when you least expect it, you will receive a letter detailing your worries, dreams and aspirations at this moment in time. I like these emails because they capture the not-so-picture-worthy moments that throw back photos can&amp;rsquo;t. A few days ago I received a letter I wrote 5 years ago and it gave me a lot to think about.</description>
