      <description>This post was supposed to be about tips to crush New Years Resolutions. I wanted to share pointers like one of those people who have life figured out. It took less than 2 weeks to be reminded of my own fragility, impermanence and imperfection. Inspite of marginal success I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m still a work in progress, we all are. If you want tips on making and actualizing your resolutions, Google Is Your Friend.</description>

      <description>I entered 2021 with lists and plans but life had plans of its own. I lost a loved one and everything changed. I&amp;rsquo;m still processing grief but if there is anything it has taught me is how short life is, how fragile, how impermanent. So, instead of chasing meaningless listicles, I chose to live and do more of what makes me happy. I ended up missing a few boxes and that&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>
