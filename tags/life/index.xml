      <description>So I picked up a new sport recently and as you may expect, it involves running. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running up mountains and I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;ve been having too much fun with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fond of both running and mountains. They both present opportunities for challenges, scenery, connection and of course endorphins. Considering the effort needed to run uphill, it just made sense to run on the road and hike mountains at a leisurely pace.</description>

      <description>Trigger Warning: grief, death
Inhale, exhale, Inhale, Exhale .. a dozen times a minute and thats enough to keep you oxygenated to do all the amazing things you are capable of. If you pause to listen you&amp;rsquo;ll hear the sound of wind, rhythmically blowing in and out of your lungs like clockwork; the original soundtrack to your life. Ideally you want that soundtrack to go on forever, we all do. However we want it, the events of last year have made it clear how much life our lives hinges on that soundtrack and how delicate it really is.</description>

      <description>My, what a year! For the first time I&amp;rsquo;m looking back at a year ago and I feel &amp;hellip; different, some degree stronger, some degree wiser, a lot more focused, and ofcourse very different. While the global review of 2020 deserves a series of encyclopedias, this post is about my personal review.
Work&amp;nbsp;Â¶I switched to a new team at Microsoft in the first week of March; the very definition of bad timing.</description>

      <description>This has been one hell of a year, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not alone with this sentiment. Sometimes it feels like a horror movie where the plot thickens at every turn. Struggles we had before are that much magnified now that we have to experience it all from home without our usual distractions. Worse than that is how much death we&amp;rsquo;ve had to endure.
We&amp;rsquo;ve lost friends and family to Covid-19, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our people to police brutality, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our celebrities, heroes and more.</description>
