      <description>Its been a while since I wrote about running, lets change that. A few months ago, I was running through never-ending flares, jumping from one medical appointment to the next and crying my way to acceptance. You know, typical rock-bottom, end of the world vibes. Four months later I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that the world infact did not end, life moved and I&amp;rsquo;m still here.
Lets recap, I spent a good chunk of last year finding and pushing my limits, averaging one ultra a month, with crazy adventures sprinkled in between.</description>
