      <description>George Mack once tweeted that once you learn about the agency trait you can&amp;rsquo;t unsee it. I&amp;rsquo;m on the other side now and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t agree more.
Its the word I didn&amp;rsquo;t know I needed, one that captures everyone I used to describe as intense, original, go-getter, ambitious and the like. Simply put, high agency people are the kind of people who write their own story. Irrespective of what the world thinks, they go after what they want, get things done and claim their place in the world.</description>
