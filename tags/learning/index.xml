      <description>I have this pebble that says &amp;ldquo;If you all can do is crawl, start crawling&amp;rdquo;. It has sentimental value, not just for the quote but it also reminds me of my state of my mind at the time I acquired it. Few weeks ago, I was in a small Norwegian town of Poulsbo where I had just finished a half marathon, high on endorphins, low in certainity. I had goals for the next few months that would stretch me way beyond my comfort zone.</description>
