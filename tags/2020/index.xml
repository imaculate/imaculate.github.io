      <description>This has been one hell of a year, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not alone with this sentiment. Sometimes it feels like a horror movie where the plot thickens at every turn. Struggles we had before are that much magnified now that we have to experience it all from home without our usual distractions. Worse than that is how much death we&amp;rsquo;ve had to endure.
We&amp;rsquo;ve lost friends and family to Covid-19, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our people to police brutality, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our celebrities, heroes and more.</description>
