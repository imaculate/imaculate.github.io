      <description>My, what a year! For the first time I&amp;rsquo;m looking back at a year ago and I feel &amp;hellip; different, some degree stronger, some degree wiser, a lot more focused, and ofcourse very different. While the global review of 2020 deserves a series of encyclopedias, this post is about my personal review.
Work&amp;nbsp;Â¶I switched to a new team at Microsoft in the first week of March; the very definition of bad timing.</description>

      <description>This has been one hell of a year, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not alone with this sentiment. Sometimes it feels like a horror movie where the plot thickens at every turn. Struggles we had before are that much magnified now that we have to experience it all from home without our usual distractions. Worse than that is how much death we&amp;rsquo;ve had to endure.
We&amp;rsquo;ve lost friends and family to Covid-19, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our people to police brutality, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our celebrities, heroes and more.</description>
