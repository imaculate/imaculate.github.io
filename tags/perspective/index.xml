      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time user of Future Me, a service that lets you email your future self letters. A few days ago I received a letter I wrote 5 years ago and it gave me a lot to think about. It told a story that throw back photos wouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell, the moments that were important but not very picture worthy. In this particular letter I wrote all the things that preoccupied my mind at the time (I was in college), in no particular order: good grades, travel, losing weight, great career.</description>
