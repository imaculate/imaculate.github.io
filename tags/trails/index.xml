      <description>So I picked up a new sport recently and as you may expect, it involves running. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running up mountains and I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;ve been having too much fun with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fond of both running and mountains. They both present opportunities for challenges, scenery, connection and of course endorphins. Considering the effort needed to run uphill, it just made sense to run on the road and hike mountains at a leisurely pace.</description>
