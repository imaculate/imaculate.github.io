      <description>Stick to the plan, trust the process, do it long enough and you&amp;rsquo;ll reach your goal, finish the race, get that medal or whatever tickles your fancy. Most times that works, we put in the work, celebrate, sign up for the next challenge and do it all over again. Its all fun and games until its not. Sure, you have the discipline to follow through with the plan but what if your heart is simply not in it anymore?</description>

      <description>10mintes 51 seconds, that&amp;rsquo;s the fastest I can run a mile, emphasis on fastest. The stars have to align for this to happen, I&amp;rsquo;d have to run on a flat surface, with good weather, fresh legs, sufficient training and of course I&amp;rsquo;d have to push really hard. In the same time, the elite marathoner Eliud Kipchoge runs twice the distance and then some. If I were to run alongside him, I&amp;rsquo;d look like Brittany while he flies ahead.</description>
