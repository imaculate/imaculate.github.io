      <description>A few weeks ago I ran my first 100K, the Badger Mountain 100K challenge. I crossed the finish line after 16 hours making it my furthest and longest effort, ever.

They&amp;rsquo;d all be valid but the real value I got from it was the fact that it was on my calendar; neatly partitioning it into a before and after era.</description>
