I aspire to be one of those people who leave this planet without a stone left unturned. No, I have no desire to live a painfully long life nor do I dream of immortality. What I really want is to reach the end, completely done, at ease with the fact that I reached my full potential. I think deep down that&amp;rsquo;s true for a lot of us; especially those of us who intentionally try to make our lives more productive.</description>

      <description>There comes a time in a one&amp;rsquo;s life when existential questions grow too loud to ignore. One that has been on my mind lately is fulfillment. It has been haunting me to the extent I thought online retailers were after me, throwing the word around like confetti; &amp;lsquo;Your order is fulfilled&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;[X] fulfillment center&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;fulfill this&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;fulfill that&amp;rsquo;. Sure, getting my package feels good but is it fulfilling? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so.</description>
