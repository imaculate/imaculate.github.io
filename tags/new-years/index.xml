      <description>My reflection of 2023 is clouded with a less than ideal Q4 but I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to give it a fair trial. Its that time of the year so as tradition detects I&amp;rsquo;ll join the rest of humanity to look back and plan forward. With a slightly different format this time, lets dive in:
Highlights&amp;nbsp;Â¶Success on my first major fundraising project for Arthtitis. Started a profitable business. PR-ed on the 50K and 50 miler.</description>

      <description>This post was supposed to be about tips to crush New Years Resolutions. I wanted to share pointers like one of those people who have life figured out. It took less than 2 weeks to be reminded of my own fragility, impermanence and imperfection. Inspite of marginal success I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m still a work in progress, we all are. If you want tips on making and actualizing your resolutions, Google Is Your Friend.</description>

      <description>Tis the season so lets talk about New Years; Photo by Cristian Escobar on Unsplash
I love the freshness and enthusiasism that comes with the calendar flip. Clouded by December merryments, we naively give ourselves permission to ignore logic and dream audaciously. I love the universality of it all; we may not celebrate the same deities but we atleast recognize the dawning of a new year. As a result, we get to collectively participate in the same ritual of looking back and plotting forward; speaking the same language of gratitude and resolutions.</description>
