      <description>This post was supposed to be about tips to crush New Years Resolutions. I wanted to share pointers like one of those people who have life figured out. It took less than 2 weeks to be reminded of my own fragility, impermanence and imperfection. Inspite of marginal success I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m still a work in progress, we all are. If you want tips on making and actualizing your resolutions, Google Is Your Friend.</description>

I love the freshness and enthusiasism that comes with the calendar flip. Clouded by December merryments, we naively give ourselves permission to ignore logic and dream audaciously. I love the universality of it all; we may not celebrate the same deities but we atleast recognize the dawning of a new year. As a result, we get to collectively participate in the same ritual of looking back and plotting forward; speaking the same language of gratitude and resolutions.</description>
