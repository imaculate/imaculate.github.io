Whoever invented the term &amp;lsquo;good grief&amp;rsquo; was clearly delusional. These are two words that should never go into the same sentence. Nothing about grief feels good. Nope, not the shock, denial, sadness, powerlessness or fear all bundled up into one hot mess. Its an intense bundle and that&amp;rsquo;s not even the worst part. The worst part is experiencing it all while world moves on. Your whole world may have turned upside down but the sun continues to shine, wheels keep churning, the music doesn&amp;rsquo;t stop.</description>

      <description>Trigger Warning: grief, death
Inhale, exhale, Inhale, Exhale .. a dozen times a minute and thats enough to keep you oxygenated to do all the amazing things you are capable of. If you pause to listen you&amp;rsquo;ll hear the sound of wind, rhythmically blowing in and out of your lungs like clockwork; the original soundtrack to your life. Ideally you want that soundtrack to go on forever, we all do. However we want it, the events of last year have made it clear how much life our lives hinges on that soundtrack and how delicate it really is.</description>
