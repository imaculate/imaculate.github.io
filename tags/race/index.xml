      <description>Every day should be a good day. People fool themselves that they&amp;rsquo;ll be here forever.
-Stephen A. Schwarzman
Saturday December 10th 2022 was a good day, of course there was a run involved. For the first time ever I ran a whole ultra on a whim and ended up running my fastest 50k to date. I say on a whim because I committed to running it at 4 am that morning.</description>

      <description>On Saturday November 13th 2021, I woke up at 5:00 am, I did some prep, read for a bit before starting my almost 20 mile bike ride to Grand Ridge Park, Issaquah. I arrived just in time to get my bib and run my first ever trail race, the Grand Ridge Half Marathon. Despite all my doubts and fears,the run went pretty well, 3 hours 18 minutes kind of flew by before I reached the finish line.</description>
