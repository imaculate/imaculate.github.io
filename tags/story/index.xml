      <description>For most people, July 6th 2023 was one of those uneventful days, hardly distinguishable from any other sunny day in Seattle. It will be hard for me to forget this fine Thursday because, as dramatic as it sounds, something happened that happens once in a lifetime. Just before 6:31pm, I swam from one end of the pool to the other unassisted for the very first time. After years of struggling with freestyle and breathing I can finally claim the swimmer badge.</description>

      <title>Trail Year</title>

      <description>A year ago I did my first trail run and wrote my first trail inspired post. Little did I know of the adventures that were about to unfold. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve not only ran my longest distance in one day (50 miles), I&amp;rsquo;ve also grown comfortable running ultras. I think that&amp;rsquo;s wild considering that the half marathon used to be my stretch distance. On reflecting on the wild year, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share some lessons I learnt.</description>

      <description>I came up with the title of this post when I was at the peak of runner&amp;rsquo;s high that is after running a full marathon last weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll be grateful if it inspires you but this its a note to self when I&amp;rsquo;ll need the reminder. This is not the first time I ran a marathon but its the first time I felt good. Yes, you read that right, I felt good even while running up a heart attack hill, I felt good on mile 23, I felt good as I finished and I felt especially good when I was functional again in 2 hours.</description>

      <description>Over my relatively short career as a Software Engineer I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of documentation. No one uses a feature they haven&amp;rsquo;t heard or read about. Compared to hours spent reading and debugging code, documentation may sound trivial but it makes a big difference for customers as well as team knowledge sharing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve subconsiously known this for a while, its why I started amazife blog as a College Freshman.</description>
