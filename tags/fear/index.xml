      <description>&amp;ldquo;I could go on forever&amp;rdquo; is not something I ever imagined I&amp;rsquo;d say after running 14+ miles with over 4000ft thousands of elevation gain, but here we are. By ultra standards that is a piece of cake but I imagine the feeling is shared by all endurance athletes. Although this post was inspired by a run, it is not another running post; its about endurance. Before we get to that, gather around for a little bit of story time.</description>

      <description>Quick question: How do you get your rice? No, rice is not a codeword for anything sketchy. I know its an odd question but bare with me for a second. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer to that question at the moment but not too long ago I had very detailed answers; I could point you to the closest grocery store with the best deals on long-grain rice, the exact aisle and the best time to shop.</description>
