      <description>This post was supposed to be about tips to crush New Years Resolutions. I wanted to share pointers like one of those people who have life figured out. It took less than 2 weeks to be reminded of my own fragility, impermanence and imperfection. Inspite of marginal success I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past, I&amp;rsquo;m still a work in progress, we all are. If you want tips on making and actualizing your resolutions, Google Is Your Friend.</description>

Sure, life is moving on; If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel like a happy ending, recall when you were self-isolating, consuming nothing but horror images and breaking news, craving hugs and better days.</description>
