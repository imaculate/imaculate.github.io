      <description>My reflection of 2023 is clouded with a less than ideal Q4 but I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best to give it a fair trial.

I love the freshness and enthusiasism that comes with the calendar flip. Clouded by December merryments, we naively give ourselves permission to ignore logic and dream audaciously.

As a result, we get to collectively participate in the same ritual of looking back and plotting forward; speaking the same language of gratitude and resolutions.</description>
