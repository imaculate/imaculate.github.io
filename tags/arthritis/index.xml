      <description>Its been a while since I wrote about running, lets change that. A few months ago, I was running through never-ending flares, jumping from one medical appointment to the next and crying my way to acceptance. You know, typical rock-bottom, end of the world vibes. Four months later I&amp;rsquo;m happy to report that the world infact did not end, life moved and I&amp;rsquo;m still here.
Lets recap, I spent a good chunk of last year finding and pushing my limits, averaging one ultra a month, with crazy adventures sprinkled in between.</description>

      <description>Most days that start with a run are good days. A 10 mile run gives just me enough endorphins to get me through the day and just enough fatigue to calm any anxiety, the world feels light and everything makes sense. Irrespective of how unpleasant the runs feels, I&amp;rsquo;m generally a pleasant person to be around afterwards. For the past few years I&amp;rsquo;ve trusted myself to be pleasant, not so much lately.</description>
