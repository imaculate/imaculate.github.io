I aspire to be one of those people who leave this planet without a stone left unturned. No, I have no desire to live a painfully long life nor do I dream of immortality. What I really want is to reach the end, completely done, at ease with the fact that I reached my full potential. I think deep down that&amp;rsquo;s true for a lot of us; especially those of us who intentionally try to make our lives more productive.</description>

Turns out productivity is top of mind whether we are in a recession or a global pandemic.</description>
