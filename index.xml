      <description>Every runner who is a also a writer writes their running story at some point. Its about time I wrote mine. I run at least 21 miles a week and have been consistently doing so for 4 years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t participate in every race there is, I&amp;rsquo;m far from a sub 2 hour half marathon, on many mornings its a struggle to get up and run. Despite all the struggles, I&amp;rsquo;m a consistent runner and sometimes a marathoner.</description>

      <description>Over my relatively short career as a Software Engineer I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of documentation. No one uses a feature they haven&amp;rsquo;t heard or read about. Compared to hours spent reading and debugging code, documentation may sound trivial but it makes a big difference for customers as well as team knowledge sharing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve subconsiously known this for a while, its why I started amazife blog as a College Freshman.</description>

      <description>📜 I spend most of my waking hours engineering software, running, writing and thinking about self-improvement. I&amp;rsquo;m currently based in Washington 🇺🇸 though I grew up in 🇹🇿 and studied in 🇿🇦 where I graduated with Electrical and Computer Engineering degree from the University of CapeTown. Welcome to my internet home!
👩‍💻 I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on your favorite Word Processor, Microsoft Word. In the past I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on both Backend and Frontend projects, more about that on my resume.</description>
