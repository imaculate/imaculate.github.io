      <description>I entered 2021 with lists and plans but life had plans of its own. I lost a loved one and everything changed. I&amp;rsquo;m still processing grief but if there is anything it has taught me is how short life is, how fragile, how impermanent. So, instead of chasing meaningless listicles, I chose to live and do more of what makes me happy. I ended up missing a few boxes and that&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>

      <description>On Saturday November 13th 2021, I woke up at 5:00 am, I did some prep, read for a bit before starting my almost 20 mile bike ride to Grand Ridge Park, Issaquah. I arrived just in time to get my bib and run my first ever trail race, the Grand Ridge Half Marathon. Despite all my doubts and fears,the run went pretty well, 3 hours 18 minutes kind of flew by before I reached the finish line.</description>

      <description>10mintes 51 seconds, that&amp;rsquo;s the fastest I can run a mile, emphasis on fastest. The stars have to align for this to happen, I&amp;rsquo;d have to run on a flat surface, with good weather, fresh legs, sufficient training and of course I&amp;rsquo;d have to push really hard. In the same time, the elite marathoner Eliud Kipchoge runs twice the distance and then some. If I were to run alongside him, I&amp;rsquo;d look like Brittany while he flies ahead.</description>

      <description>I have this pebble that says &amp;ldquo;If you all can do is crawl, start crawling&amp;rdquo;. It has sentimental value, not just for the quote but it also reminds me of my state of my mind at the time I acquired it. Few weeks ago, I was in a small Norwegian town of Poulsbo where I had just finished a half marathon, high on endorphins, low in certainity. I had goals for the next few months that would stretch me way beyond my comfort zone.</description>

      <description>Fun fact about me, I have terrible sense of direction. Whenever I go someplace new, I budget for at least 15 minutes of getting lost. It happens so often that getting it right the first feels unnatural. A few highlights include the time I lost the bike trail and ended up biking on the highway (!!Do not try this at home!!), the one time I got lost kayaking on a lake (yes, that is possible), the time I spent finding my way in Osaka which was 100% of the time.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I could go on forever&amp;rdquo; is not something I ever imagined I&amp;rsquo;d say after running 14+ miles with over 4000ft thousands of elevation gain, but here we are. By ultra standards that is a piece of cake but I imagine the feeling is shared by all endurance athletes. Although this post was inspired by a run, it is not another running post; its about endurance. Before we get to that, gather around for a little bit of story time.</description>

      <title>Life lessons from the trail</title>

      <description>So I picked up a new sport recently and as you may expect, it involves running. I&amp;rsquo;ve been running up mountains and I have to admit I&amp;rsquo;ve been having too much fun with it. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fond of both running and mountains. They both present opportunities for challenges, scenery, connection and of course endorphins. Considering the effort needed to run uphill, it just made sense to run on the road and hike mountains at a leisurely pace.</description>

      <description>Quick question: How do you get your rice? No, rice is not a codeword for anything sketchy. I know its an odd question but bare with me for a second. I don&amp;rsquo;t have an answer to that question at the moment but not too long ago I had very detailed answers; I could point you to the closest grocery store with the best deals on long-grain rice, the exact aisle and the best time to shop.</description>

      <description>Trigger Warning: grief, death
Inhale, exhale, Inhale, Exhale .. a dozen times a minute and thats enough to keep you oxygenated to do all the amazing things you are capable of. If you pause to listen you&amp;rsquo;ll hear the sound of wind, rhythmically blowing in and out of your lungs like clockwork; the original soundtrack to your life. Ideally you want that soundtrack to go on forever, we all do. However we want it, the events of last year have made it clear how much life our lives hinges on that soundtrack and how delicate it really is.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long time user of Future Me, a service that lets you send emails to the future. At the chosen date, when you least expect it, you will receive a letter detailing your worries, dreams and aspirations at this moment in time. I like these emails because they capture the not-so-picture-worthy moments that throw back photos can&amp;rsquo;t. A few days ago I received a letter I wrote 5 years ago and it gave me a lot to think about.</description>

      <description>My, what a year! For the first time I&amp;rsquo;m looking back at a year ago and I feel &amp;hellip; different, some degree stronger, some degree wiser, a lot more focused, and ofcourse very different. While the global review of 2020 deserves a series of encyclopedias, this post is about my personal review.
Work&amp;nbsp;Â¶I switched to a new team at Microsoft in the first week of March; the very definition of bad timing.</description>

      <description>This has been one hell of a year, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not alone with this sentiment. Sometimes it feels like a horror movie where the plot thickens at every turn. Struggles we had before are that much magnified now that we have to experience it all from home without our usual distractions. Worse than that is how much death we&amp;rsquo;ve had to endure.
We&amp;rsquo;ve lost friends and family to Covid-19, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our people to police brutality, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost our celebrities, heroes and more.</description>

      <description>Yes you spelled it right, not heat, HIIT! as in High Intensity Interval Training. By definition, HIIT is a form of training that involves cycles of short bursts on intense training followed by less intense recovery until fatigue/ exhaustion, in other words if you find yourself gasping for air throughout the workout, you are most likely HIITing. I don&amp;rsquo;t look forward to HIIT day but I love it, here is why.</description>

      <description>Making big desicions takes significant time and effort, a good example: Career Planning. I started thinking about my career since the day I was able to form full sentences. It was inevitable considering &amp;ldquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&amp;rdquo; was part of the script of conversing with adults. My responce to the question varied all the time from nun to teacher to musician, to poet to doctor.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Almost there&amp;rdquo;; sometimes these are the words of comfort I need to hear and sometimes they make want to attack the utterer. Being a runner and hiker means I get to hear them a lot more often than I want to. I love the intent behind them, they mean well. When I&amp;rsquo;m near the finish line, I welcome all variations of &amp;ldquo;Almost there&amp;rdquo; because its true, I can see the finish line and any form of discomfort I&amp;rsquo;m experiencing is bound to be over soon.</description>

      <description>I came up with the title of this post when I was at the peak of runner&amp;rsquo;s high that is after running a full marathon last weekend. I&amp;rsquo;ll be grateful if it inspires you but this its a note to self when I&amp;rsquo;ll need the reminder. This is not the first time I ran a marathon but its the first time I felt good. Yes, you read that right, I felt good even while running up a heart attack hill, I felt good on mile 23, I felt good as I finished and I felt especially good when I was functional again in 2 hours.</description>

      <description>Every runner who is a also a writer writes their running story at some point. Its about time I wrote mine. I run at least 21 miles a week and have been consistently doing so for 4 years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t participate in every race there is, I&amp;rsquo;m far from a sub 2 hour half marathon, on many mornings its a struggle to get up and run. Despite all the struggles, I&amp;rsquo;m a consistent runner and sometimes a marathoner.</description>

      <description>Over my relatively short career as a Software Engineer I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of documentation. No one uses a feature they haven&amp;rsquo;t heard or read about. Compared to hours spent reading and debugging code, documentation may sound trivial but it makes a big difference for customers as well as team knowledge sharing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve subconsiously known this for a while, its why I started amazife blog as a College Freshman.</description>
