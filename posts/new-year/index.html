<p>My, what a year! For the first time I&rsquo;m looking back at a year ago and I feel &hellip; different, some degree stronger, some degree wiser, a lot more focused, and ofcourse very different. While the global review of 2020 deserves a series of encyclopedias, this post is about my personal review.</p>

<h1 id="work" class="anchor-link"><a href="#work">Work<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<p>I switched to a new team at Microsoft in the first week of March; the very definition of bad timing. Although I saw my new colleagues in person for a grand total of 3 days, it wasn&rsquo;t all bad. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, onboarding to one of the oldest codebase ever was anything but easy, but one step at a time I got to be an active contributor for your favorite word processor. That said I won&rsquo;t ever underestimate my ability to adapt. I could get used to working from home, perhaps because I&rsquo;ve worked remotely for most of my short career or that I appreciate the extra hours in the day, either way I&rsquo;m excited for what 2021 has to offer.</p>

<h1 id="fitness" class="anchor-link"><a href="#fitness">Fitness<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<p>There are many reasons why fitness goals are the most popular resolutions. They are difficult yet achievable, measurable and actionable; with every action, we step a tiny bit out of our comfort zone. My fitness resolutions were to be more consistent, incorporate strength training and run 2 full marathons. I achieved 80% of them, which is 100% more than my expectations. A few highlights &hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Started tracking my workouts on Strava which didn&rsquo;t hurt on accountability.</li>
<li>Ran a virtual marathon and a couple of half marathons. Wrote about virtual race experience <a href="http://imaculate.github.io/posts/marathon/">here</a></li>
<li>Picked up biking, trained my way to my first <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/4018119259">century ride</a></li>
<li>Caught the HIIT bug, even wrote about it <a href="http://imaculate.github.io/posts/hiit/">here</a></li>
<li>As a result of consistency, I have climbed the equivalent of Kilimanjaros.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is no way indication that 2020 was a good year, it just came with more free time and a lot to cope with, for me that translates to more exercise. This year I&rsquo;d like to keep the momentum and when it&rsquo;s safe to do so, venture into winter sports and definitely not sign up for any tri-athlon üòÅ.</p>

<h1 id="finance" class="anchor-link"><a href="#finance">Finance<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<p>Something about minimalism, investing, home ownership, all the good stuff.</p>

<h1 id="writing" class="anchor-link"><a href="#writing">Writing<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Revamped the personal blog which you are now reading.</li>
<li>Started writing technical posts again, you can find them on <a href="https://dev.to/imaculate3">dev.to</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I have grand plans for 2021 which will start with the million drafts that have been side eyeing me.</p>

<h1 id="speaking" class="anchor-link"><a href="#speaking">Speaking<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<p>I got to do virtual speaking engagements even though I was terrified of accepting the invitations.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/1516007761963126/videos/312869189698987/">Projekt Inspire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMwZD37rL-A&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;ab_channel=SmartclassTanzania">Smart class</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wcs.cs.uct.ac.za/index.php/2020/08/15/womens-day-girl-talk/">Women In Computer Science, UCT</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t think I would enjoy it until I did. That said, I&rsquo;m available to speak on all things tech.</p>

<h1 id="reading" class="anchor-link"><a href="#reading">Reading<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
<p>This was one of the rare years where I exceeded expectations on the Goodreads reading challenge. A by-product of listening to audiobooks while walking, making jewellery, doing chores and all the gloriously mundane activities of 2020. I&rsquo;ve committed to 12 books in 2021 but its a nice to have rather than must-have. The goal of reading is to learn, not to keep score.</p>

<h1 id="miscellaneous" class="anchor-link"><a href="#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¬∂</span></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>I discovered a cool quarantine-friendly, netflix-friendly hobby of making earrings. I&rsquo;m a big fan of flashy earrings and my main motivation was to save money on my jewellery budget. 40 pairs later, I&rsquo;m still at it. I also got to auction some off in the annual Microsoft fundraising campaign. You can find my collection <a href="http://imaculate.github.io/jewels/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/imaculatem/">instagram</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">

</p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Piano: Produced slightly less embarassing clips like the soundtrack of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/imaculate-mosha/somewhereinmymemory">Home Alone</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Photography: Managed to score a few more <a href="https://www.viewbug.com/member/imaculatemosha#/imaculatemosha/awards?filter=vbawards">viewbug awards</a> despite scaling down due to stay at home.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And that was my 2020, or rather the quantifiable part. The year that passed in an eye&rsquo;s blink and yet felt like a century. The year that suprised us, broke us and re-aligned out priorities. Most of us will spend a good chunk of 2021 simply recovering from it. When the wounds turn into scars, I hope we can look back and realize that it was the year of growth. Happy New Year!</p>
