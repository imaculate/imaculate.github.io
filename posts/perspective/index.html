        <p>I&rsquo;ve been a long time user of <a href="https://www.futureme.org/">Future Me</a>, a service that lets you email your future self letters. A few days ago I received a letter I wrote 5 years ago and it gave me a lot to think about. It told a story that throw back photos wouldn&rsquo;t tell, the moments that were important but not very picture worthy. In this particular letter I wrote all the things that preoccupied my mind at the time (I was in college), in no particular order: good grades, travel, losing weight, great career. Sometimes I fail to recognize the happy go-lucky girl from my polished facebook timeline but as for the focused go-getter who wrote the letter, I can definitely empathize with and I wish I could write back.</p>
<p>See, I&rsquo;m a maximizer when it comes to goals. That means I&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to reach a goal, reach it, only to jumpstart the next one. Unlike satisficers, who know when to stop after reaching a target, maximizers keep moving the goal post. This is an inevitable outcome of my upbringing. Anyone raised by African parents, (I suspect parents everywhere) understands the pressure, its not enough to just top the class, the real prize is in staying on top, then the prestigious college, then the fancy job, the fancy car &hellip; you get where I&rsquo;m going with this. In my room, there was a wall picture with the quotes: <code>It is easy to become number one but so hard to stay number one</code>. It&rsquo;d be a miracle if I didn&rsquo;t turn out the way I did.</p>
<p>[Insert the cat picture]</p>
<p>So yeah, that&rsquo;s how I ended up exceling in school, getting the most exclusive opportunities to where I am today. Since early on, I understood that time is too precious to be wasted not chasing dreams. It becomes a priority to be optimize it for maximal reward, it becomes standard to always be upto something, catching one goal after another like pokemons.</p>
<p>Its all great until you wake up to the realization that there is always more pokemons and no matter how many you&rsquo;ve caught, its never gonna be enough. That&rsquo;s the curse of the maximizer, while you are busy zooming in on what you are lacking, you fail to see and appreciate what you already have. This, right here is what I would write back to my younger self. I would tell her, she had reached her optimal weight and shouldn&rsquo;t obsess over calorie counting; the career that she wanted so badly was infact just a job that didn&rsquo;t have to consume her. She definitely had more room for fun and perhaps would be better off figuring out who she is besides her achievements. If I could write back I would nudge her to appreciate how good she had it and hopeful make her [realize, (reword this?)] that when the goal posts is always moving, any attempt to reach it is by definition, futile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reaching to the maximizers, to anyone who feels they have to be hard on themselves for simply existing through the pandemic.
I don&rsquo;t have all the answers but I do know that perspective is key. When you catch yourself spiraling into <code>Not Enough</code> thoughts, it helps to think past the moment. Knowing what you know what wisdom w you pass to your younger self? What are you taking foregranted right now? 5 years from now, when hopefully life is somewhat normal, what will you remember about these trying times? Is whatever you are stressing about still be important? If future you could talk back what would they relay? If one things is certain, its that the future will come to pass. I hope when it does, you will look back with no regrets because life is a series of fleeting moments.</p>
