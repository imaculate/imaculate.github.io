<p>10mintes 51 seconds, that&rsquo;s the fastest I can run a mile, emphasis on <strong>fastest</strong>. The stars have to align for this to happen, I&rsquo;d have to run on a flat surface, with good weather, fresh legs, sufficient training and of course I&rsquo;d have to push really hard. In the same time, the elite marathoner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge">Eliud Kipchoge</a> runs twice the distance and then some. If I were to run alongside him, I&rsquo;d look like <a href="https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxMd_QCTOppK8YKN_2tnNeYv_LSATpzn87">Brittany</a> while he flies ahead. Depending on your outlook, the imagery is either really inspiring or simply embarrasing. Either way, there is no denying that I&rsquo;m slow.</p>
<p>Of course I should expect to be slower than an elite runner, but surely I&rsquo;ve got to at least match the average runner, right? Well, here are the facts, I&rsquo;ll let you be the judge. In most group runs, I run with the sweeper. In races, I run with the party pace crowd not because I&rsquo;m undertrained or taking it easy. I&rsquo;ve grown used to the sound of people passing despite doing my best effort. I&rsquo;ve even been the sweeper at one small race. So yeah, I&rsquo;m universally slow, a fact that doesn&rsquo;t sit well with my Type A personality. When your brain is wired for control, competition and winning, it takescomplete mindset refinement to accept what feels like defeat. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I&rsquo;ve definitely got faster over years of running, just not fast enough. Despite all that, I keep running and showing up at races, here&rsquo;s why:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its a number&rsquo;s game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone punched the <a href="https://runandbeyond.com/finish-time-distribution/">numbers</a> and confirmed that runner&rsquo;s paces are no exception to the bell curve. I fall on the tapering edge of the curve (whichever represents the slow ones), so statistically speaking, most runners are faster than me. There is a few of us hanging out at this edge, and its validating to know that we exist. When I struggle to keep up, its comforting to know that I&rsquo;m neither abnormal nor a failure, I&rsquo;m simply a statistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>Its all relative.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some races I&rsquo;m in the middle of the pack, in others I sweep. I wish I was fast as some of my friends but they wish they were faster than other runners. Years ago I wished I was this fast, here I am wishing I was faster. In other words, irrespective of where I am I will always want to be faster. 
If I&rsquo;m gonna be at this for the rest of my life, I might as well appreciate how far I&rsquo;ve come and enjoy the process.</p>
<ul>
<li>Limitations means more challenges.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m too slow to qualify for Boston Marathon or make the cut-off for a 100 miler but there are so many other ways I can challenge myself. I have yet to run a sub-2 hour half marathon but am getting closer year after year. I have yet to run an ultra but I will be running my first 50k in a few months, the primary goal being to make the cut-off. I have yet to find out how far or how high I can go in a timed race. With my limits, I have a lot more goal posts to reach, more opportunities to grow and more milestones to be celebrate, an unexpected upside.</p>
<ul>
<li>Minority bond.</li>
</ul>
<p>The minority bond is the instant connection you make with people in the same minority group as you. I&rsquo;m familiar with it not only as a black woman in tech but also as a runner. While majority of runners are at the peak of the bell curve, a few of us are at the edge and its always exciting when we find each other. In some races I&rsquo;ve ran, I&rsquo;ve connected with complete strangers simply because our paces match. Side by side as we run and talk about out of our shared passion and struggles, unlikely connections are made.</p>
<ul>
<li>More flow.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the things I like about running is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> I get to experience when I&rsquo;m in the zone. Being slow means for the same distance I get to experience it longer; not a outcome. Quoting <a href="https://hectorgarcia.org/">Hector Garcia</a> from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/40534545">Ikigai</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The happiest people are not the ones who achieve the most. They are the ones who spend more time than others in a state of flow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every day, I have to contend with the fact that I&rsquo;m not good at something I love, that my best effort is not good enough and that I&rsquo;m probably not a serious runner. Its not all bad because I also get to practice acceptance for things that are beyond my control, gratitude for what my body is capable of doing and audacity to reach new limits. I may not win any awards but I will certainly beat the competition. My competiton has and will always be the girl in the mirror.</p>
