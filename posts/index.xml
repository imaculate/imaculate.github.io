      <description>Every runner who is a also a writer writes their running story at some point. Its about time I wrote mine. I run at least 21 miles a week and have been consistently doing so for 4 years now. I don&amp;rsquo;t participate in every race there is, I&amp;rsquo;m far from a sub 2 hour half marathon, on many mornings its a struggle to get up and run. Despite all the struggles, I&amp;rsquo;m a consistent runner and sometimes a marathoner.</description>

      <description>Over my relatively short career as a Software Engineer I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize the importance of documentation. No one uses a feature they haven&amp;rsquo;t heard or read about. Compared to hours spent reading and debugging code, documentation may sound trivial but it makes a big difference for customers as well as team knowledge sharing.
I&amp;rsquo;ve subconsiously known this for a while, its why I started amazife blog as a College Freshman.</description>
