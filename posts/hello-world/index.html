<p>I&rsquo;ve subconsiously known this for a while, its why I started <a href="http://amazife.blogspot.com/">amazife blog</a> as a College Freshman. A lot has changed and so have I but my appetite for writing hasn&rsquo;t. I hope that my writing relates with you, inspires you, teaches you or at the very least adds some value to your life. In the spirit of first post, hello world, again!</p>
