<p>Saturday December 10th 2022 was a good day, of course there was a run involved. For the first time ever I ran a whole ultra on a whim and ended up running my fastest 50k to date. I say on a whim because I committed to running it at 4 am that morning. Normally I would plan every detail of race day far in advance but I signed up for this race way before I found out that I can expect <a href="https://imaculate.github.io/posts/chapter/">unpredictable flares of inflammation</a> for the rest of my life. 2 days leading up to the race, I was in such pain that I couldn&rsquo;t comprehend sustaining 31 miles of repetitive motion. I resolved to attempt the race only if legs felt remotely better and that desicion would be made at 4am, the latest I could defer that desicion.</p>
<p>Running the race was reward in itself; the course traverses one the most beautiful parks in the state. The views were so breathtaking that at times I forgot I was in a race; even when the going got tough I embraced it with gratitude; I meditated, conversed with fellow runners, took breaks as needed and before I knew it, the finish line came to view. Sure there were annoyances like freezing temperatures, loud runners on the trail and 2 hour traffic back home but I was too content to care. I came, I saw, I conquered; it was a great day.</p>

<p>Its hard to pinpoint what exactly made it great but it had all the elements. There was the <strong>Spontaneity</strong> of it all, <strong>Awe</strong> in the scenery, <strong>Novelty</strong> in the new trails, Indulgence in my favorite <strong>Passion</strong>; running, a clearly defined <strong>challenge</strong> that seemed out of reach, <strong>Surpassing</strong> my expectations and the cherry on top meaningful <strong>connection</strong> with fellow runners. If I were to enlist everything I value in life I think this would be it. Some days you get none or a handful of them but once in a full moon they all come together to brew the perfect storm. These are the memorable days we call good days; accrue a bunch of them regularly and you have a good life.</p>
<p>There is a reason good days are hard to come by. It takes effort, perfect timing and some luck for the elements to align. We can&rsquo;t control timing or luck but effort is well within our sphere of influence. We can proactively direct our time and energy to things that fulfill us; even in dire circumstances, we can do our best. It would have been a very different day if I let bad weather or inflammation stop me from training.</p>
<p>Good days are obviously good for us. We need them to make the bad days bearable, we need them to live a fulfilled life. We have to work for them but they are so worth it. As you make grand resolutions for the new year or modest weekend plans, I hope you choose good days. Thanks for reading and have a great day!</p>
