<p>I entered 2021 with lists and plans but life had plans of its own. I lost a <a href="https://imaculate.github.io/posts/breathe/">loved one</a> and everything changed. I&rsquo;m still processing grief but if there is anything it has taught me is how short life is, how fragile, how impermanent. So, instead of chasing meaningless listicles, I chose to live and do more of what makes me happy. I ended up missing a few boxes and that&rsquo;s okay. As tradition goes, here is a summary of the year went.</p>

<h1 id="fitness" class="anchor-link"><a href="#fitness">Fitness<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I tried trail running and got hooked, you can read all about it <a href="https://imaculate.github.io/posts/trails/">here</a>. 
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../tr4.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not that I care but my Strava stats increased substantially from last year. Grateful for the opportunity and I hope to continue to play for as long as I can.
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../Strava2021.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also enjoyed a ton of races, which also appears something that <a href="https://imaculate.github.io/posts/why-i-race">makes me happy</a>. More to that!
<p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../RaceCollage.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="writing" class="anchor-link"><a href="#writing">Writing<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<ul>
<li>I completed a sizable technical writing project and I can&rsquo;t wait to share it when its ready for public eyes.</li>
<li>I semi-consistently blogged here, something I plan to continue to do whenever I have something to share.</li>
<li>Super stocked about the writing projects I have lined up for next year.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="reading" class="anchor-link"><a href="#reading">Reading<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>I once again surpassed my goal of reading 1 book a month.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../Goodreads2021.PNG" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>Some of these books were educational, some were entertaining, some were validating but all of them were thoroughly enjoyed. What this collage doesn&rsquo;t show are the ones I didn&rsquo;t finish because they weren&rsquo;t a good fit. Something I&rsquo;m totally okay with. I&rsquo;ll shoot for 20 books next year, more of a suggestion, the goal being to expand my horizons through books or otherwise.</p>

<h1 id="finance" class="anchor-link"><a href="#finance">Finance<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>Finance doesn&rsquo;t particularly excite me but I took the time to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54814845">Get Good With Money</a> which turned to a great read. Next year I intend to continue to practice minimalism, responsible investing and keep it boring generally.</p>

<h1 id="miscellaneous" class="anchor-link"><a href="#miscellaneous">Miscellaneous<span class="pilcrow">&nbsp;¶</span></a></h1>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t complete as many crafting projects as I wanted, neither did I play the piano as much but I do not regret the fun I had instead.</p>
<p><p style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="../../2021Collage2.jpg" alt=""  />
</p>
</p>
<p>So, in case its not clear, I have no resolutions. The idea of writing things to accomplish like a robot doesn&rsquo;t appeal to me anymore. Instead I have a few priorities and general direction I&rsquo;ll be heading to, I&rsquo;ll be heading towards adventures, growth and of course happiness. Happy New Years friends!</p>
