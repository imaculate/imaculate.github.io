        		<h1>Hi there</h1>
				<p> I'm a motivated student , (sorta) . I study Electrical and Computer Engineering, I like Computer Science more its okay if you think I'm a 
				Computer Science Major.
				<p> Whatever I do is along the lines of Science, Technology and Writing hence I have two blogs. I write about technology <a href = www.technofunology.blogspot.co.za> here </a>
				and I write about life and science <a href = www.amazife.blogspot.co.za>here </a>
				
				<p> Along the lines of programming I've done a couple of projects both personal and internal projects. I have interned at Niafikra, Digiata and j5 International and really enjoyed my time there. Fun fact, I wrote a couple of 
					books before starting college at APE network. </p>
					
	
				<p> I love competitions. In my busy engineering life, I make time for competitions like ACM-ICPC , Dyalog APL competition , devpost online hackathons among others and won some too!</p> 
				<p> I have become interested in Machine Learning and I see myself doing a postgrad in that </p>
				
				<p>I'm the acting ChairPerson of Women in Computer Science Society.
					Over the years at UCT I have been involved as a Google Student Ambassador, Class Representative, tutor  mentor and committee member of Golden Future Society.</p>
					<p> I do love travelling , (and taken a lot of risks travelling during semester time) I have been to Grace Hopper twice, to Switzerland, Ghana and more to come. </p> 
					<p> In my spare time , I run (try to ) </p>
