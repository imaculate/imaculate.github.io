        		<span><span style="font-size:15px;font-style=italic">"I would love to believe, that when I die I will live again, that some thinking, feeling, remembering part of me will continue. But as much as I want to believe that, and despite that ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife  I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability is to look death in the eye and to be greatful everyday for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides."</span> -<b>Carl Sagan</b> </span></br>

        		<p>It recently hit me how short life is. Ever since, I have made it a point to make the most of it. On that note, I code, write, listen, read, run, hike, travel and snap photos.</p>

        		<h1> Technically speaking </h1>
                <img src="Images/coding.jpeg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p> I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at Amazon CapeTown where I get to work on Amazon Web Services. This follows my recent graduation from the <a href = "https://www.uct.ac.za/" target="_blank">University of CapeTown</a> where I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering. In the four short years, I did software engineering internships, pet projects, department tutoring, research assistantships, won a couple of awards and competitions, published a paper, led a number of student societies and even started the <a>Women In Computer Science Society</a>. Although a Type A personality shines through <a>my resume</a>, I simply like to throw myself at things, especially the mysterious ones. I'm currently enjoying time in industry, I will probably miss college at some point and when I do, I'll probably do a postgrad in Machine Learning or Software Development Productivity. </p>

        		<h1> On writing</h1>
                <img src="Images/writing.jpg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p> If there was an elixir for immortality, I would buy it without question. Although physical  immortality is impossible, I've figured that pinning down my thoughts and imaginations may give me a fair share of that. My writing begins with software and extends well beyond that. Before university, I wrote revision textbooks for high school  <a href = "http://www.apenetwork.org/book/advanced-mathematics-2-review-285358924" target="_blank">Mathematics</a> and  <a href = "http://www.apenetwork.org/book/advanced-physics-2-review-528975886" target="_blank">Physics</a> which have received good reviews. I've also written songs that were performed at school and stories that won international competitions. Lately, I have been pouring my soul on  <a href = "http://amazife.blogspot.co.za" target="_blank"> Amazife </a> and my technical learnings and events  at  <a href = "http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za" target="_blank"> Techofunology. </a>, while working on a very exciting project on the side. You will be seeing at the bookstore soon, stay tuned! </p>
        		

        		<h1> On Reading </h1>
                <img src="Images/reading.jpg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p> As much as I like to do things, my only desire in the evenings is to observe things from the comfort of my bed and reading gives me exactly that. I read widely on psychology, history, science, biographies and of course software development. I'm currently reading <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer" target="_blank">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>, <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20578533-the-fortunes-of-africa" target="_blank"> Fortunes of Africa </a> and <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25894085-becoming-wise" target="_blank">Becoming Wise </a>, yes that's three books at a time. I'm interested in what you are reading so please add me on <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49284978-imaculate" target = "_blank"> goodreads.</a> </p>

        		<h1> On running </h1>
                <img src="Images/running.jpg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p> About 1.5 years ago I started running and I've never looked back. Sometimes it is painful and dreadful but on must days I look forward to starting my day at 5am by running away from problems, running up a hill and by the beach, sweating like a pig and greeting fellow runners. I have had thoughts of quitting but endorphins is not a bad addiction to have so it will stick for a little longer.</p>

        		<h1> On hiking </h1>
                <img src="Images/Hiking.jpg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p>Living in CapeTown has given me the innevitable bug <strike>ritual </strike> of mountain climbing. I look forward to being high up, preferably with friends, where everything is small again. </p> 

        		<h1> On listening </h1>
        		<p>I primarily use my legs for commuting and I try to make experience pleasurable with podcasts. Its a recent thing I've started and my favourites are <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/onbeing" target = "_blank"> On Being</a> , <a href = "http://tim.blog/podcast/" target = "_blank"> Tim Ferris show </a> and <a href = "http://www.madfientist.com/podcast/" target = "_blank"> Mad Fientist </a>. I'm interested in what you are listening so please add me on soundcloud. </p>
        		
        		<h1> On travelling </h1>
                <img src="Images/venice.JPG" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
                <figcaption> Absorbing Venice </figcaption>
        		<p>Sorry to disappoint you if you actually think I'm a responsible adult. Well, I try but my priorities quickly change when a travelling opportunity knocks. I've taken lots of risks travelling during semester time mostly to attend and present at international events like Google Scholars Retreat in Zurich 2014, Google Student Ambassador Summit in Accra 2014, Grace Hopper Conference in the US 2014 and 2015, Amandla Fellowship in Malawi 2016, Google Android Camp in London 2016, International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP) in Japan 2016, NIPS and Women In Machine Learning Workshop (WIML) in Barcelona 2016, Web Summit in Lisbon 2016, International Conference on Machine Learning and Soft Computing (ICMLSC) in Vietnam 2017... to be continued. I hope to bump into you somewhere on this pale blue dot. </p>


        		<h1> On photography </h1> 
                <img src="Images/camera.jpg" alt="hi" class="resize center" />
        		<p>I'm not a pro, neither do I have a fancy camera but I'm always on the lookout for good memories and views. See more <a href  = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/culey/" target = "_blank">here </a></p>
