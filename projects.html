		Here is a list of independent and research projects I have enjoyed working on. It would include my internship projects but NDA's .:(. 

		<h2> Prototype Projects</h2>
		<h4>Undergraduate thesis </h4>
			I have started working on my undergraduate thesis involving Machine Learning specifically Kohonen Self Organising Maps. Stay tuned for more updates.
		<h4> Simple Sequencing Prototype </h4>
			I created a web application prototype for <a href="http://www.husseinsspace.com"  target="_blank">Dr.Hussein Suleiman's</a> research group. The application enables instructors to sequence their resources using the IMS Simple Sequencing standard. I implemented it Nodejs and the following technologies: Java, Apache libraries and ffmpeg. I made my flavor of the Apache POI library <a href="https://github.com/imaculate/JavaSlides">here</a>. I used various js frameworks for the front end including <a href="http://www.introjs.com"  target="_blank">introjs</a>, <a href="http://www.guidejs.com"  target="_blank">guidejs</a>, <a href="http://www.sequencejs.com"  target="_blank">sequencejs</a>, <a href="http://jonmiles.github.io/bootstrap-treeview/"> bootstrap treeview </a> and <a href="http://www.interactjs.com"  target="_blank">interactjs</a>. 
			I wrote about it <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a>. 

		<h4> Double Check </h4> 
			Ever got frustrated because someone(or you) hit reply all where they shouldn't have? Have you sent email to the wrong recipient with a similar name or even worse, replied to yourself instead of the other party? I created an outlook addin for a <a href= "http://msoffice365.devpost.com/">Devpost competition</a>. It enables you to double check the recipients of an email with a single click before sending.
			The demo can be found <a href="http:devpost.com/software/doublecheck" target="_blank">here</a>. I wrote it in JavaScript and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/imaculate/DoubleCheck" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<h4> Investec IT Challenge </h4>
			I took part in Investec IT Explore, a hackathon organised by Investec. In a group a 5, we were required to gamify the youth account application to encourage the culture of saving. 
			We came up with a game that unlocked 360 degrees view of pretty things with more savings.I worked on the backend in Nodejs as well as <a href="http://reeljs.com" target="_blank">Reeljs</a> for the front end. We were applauded for the most impressive front end. 
			I wrote a post about it <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/01/what-i-have-been-upto-investec-itexplore.html"  target="_blank">here</a> and the source code can be found <a href="http://bitbucket.org/"  target="_blank">here</a>.

		<h4> Footsteps</h4>
			I participated in yet another devpost competition that was intended to make people happier. I created an android application called  <a href="http://devpost.com/software/footsteps"  target="_blank">Footsteps</a>. It gives you stories of your role models based on how you are feeling. It was among the top 10 worldwide. 
			I wrote about it <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a> and the source is available <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a>. 

		<h4> Women In Computer Science website </h4>
			Being ChairPerson of the Society, I created the society's website. Check it out over <a href="http://wcs.cs.uct.ac.za" target="_blank">here</a>.  

		<h4> Android resizer </h4>
			I made a desktop application to resize images to different sizes used in Android development (small, medium , large). I implemented in JavaFx for the Grahical User Interface. Check it out over <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a>.


		<h2> Algorithmic Projects</h2>

		<h4> Dyalog APL Competition 2015 </h4> 
			I took part in the Dyalog APL competition and was among the top 20 <a href="" target="_blank">world wide</a>. 
			APL (<b>A</b>  <b>P</b>rogramming <b>L</b>anguage) is an array oriented language and Dyalog APL is one flavour of APL. It uses almost explicitly Greek symbols. I had so much fun playing with it. My solutions are available <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a>.

		<h4> Project Euler </h4>
			When I miss Math, I solve problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.I have solved 53 so far. 

		<h4> ACM ICPC </h4>
			Since 2013 I have been participating in Regional <a href="http://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">ACM -ICPC</a> competition. Last year my team was the 8th in Sub Saharan Africa. 


		<h2> Class projects I have enjoyed </h2>

		<h4> Intelligent MineSweeper</h4>
			I implemented an agent that learns to play MineSweeper using Reinforcement Learning. It was implemented in C++.This was an assignment for the Machine Learning course. The source code can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>


		<h4> (YODA)Your Own Digital Accelerator</h4>
			I worked in a team of 3. We accelerated computation of the MD5 checksum on an FPGA(Nesyxs 4 board). This was a project for the <a href="" target="_blank">Digital Systems</a> course. It was implemented in Pythona and Verilog
			The source code can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>

		<h4> Rubik's Cube Solver </h4>
			I implemented a brute force algorithm that solves the Rubik's cube in Scheme. This was a Computer Science assignment.
			The source code can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>



		<h4> Accela </h4> 
			I worked in a team of 5.
			We created a musical instrument that alters the volume and pitch of sound based on hand gestures. It was implemented on the STM32F4 Microcontroller in C. This was a project for the <a href="" target="_blank">Embedded Systems</a>course. 
			The source code can be found <a href="" target="_blank">here</a>




		<p>Overall I have worked with the following languages/technologies: Java, Python, C, C++, Javascript, APL, HTML, CSS, VHDL, Verilog, Scheme, Lisp, OpenCL, OpenGL, Matlab, Octave, Groovy ...I lost count too! Generally, my goto languages are Java and Python. </p>
