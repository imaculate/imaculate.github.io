		Here is a list of independent and research projects I have enjoyed working on. It would include my internship projects but NDA's .:(. 
		<h5> Prototypes </h5>
		<h4>Undergraduate thesis </h4>
			I have started working on my undergraduate thesis involving Machine Learning specifically Kohonen Self Organising Maps. Stay tuned for more updates.
		<h4> Simple Sequencing Prototype </h4>
			I created a web application prototype for <a href="http://www.husseinsspace.com"  target="_blank">Dr.Hussein Suleiman's</a> research group. The application enables instructors to sequence their resources using the IMS Simple Sequencing standard. I implemented it Nodejs and the following technologies: Java, Apache libraries and ffmpeg. I made my flavor of the Apache POI library <a href="https://github.com/imaculate/JavaSlides">here</a>. I used various js frameworks for the front end including <a href="http://www.introjs.com"  target="_blank">introjs</a>, <a href="http://www.guidejs.com"  target="_blank">guidejs</a>, <a href="http://www.sequencejs.com"  target="_blank">sequencejs</a>, bootstrap treeview and <a href="http://www.interactjs.com"  target="_blank">interactjs</a>. 
			I wrote about it <a href="http://technofunology.blogspot.co.za/2016/05/my-research-assistant-experience.html"  target="_blank">here</a>. 

		<h4> Double Check </h4> 
			Ever got frustrated because someone hit reply all where they shouldn't have? Have you sent email to the wrong recipient with a similar name or even wore replied to yourself instead of the other party? I created an <a href= "http://devpost.com/software/doublecheck" target="_blank">outlook addin</a> for a <a href= "http://msoffice365.devpost.com/">Devpost competition</a>. It enables you to double check the recipients of an email with a single click before sending.
			The source code can be found <a href="https://github.com/imaculate/DoubleCheck" target="_blank">here</a>

		<h4> Investec IT Challenge </h4>
			I took part in Investec IT Explore. 
			I wrote a post about it here.

		<h4> Footsteps</h4>

		<h4> Women In Computer Science website </h4>
			Being ChairPerson of the Society, I created the website. Check it out over <a href="http://wcs.cs.uct.ac.za" target="_blank">here</a>. 



		<h5> Algorithmic </h5>

		<h4> Dyalog APL Competition 2015 </h4> 
			I took part in this competition and was among the top 20 <a href="" target="_blank">world wide</a>. 
			APL (<b>A</b>  <b>P</b>rogramming <b>L</b>anguage) is an array oriented language and Dyalog APL is a flavour. It uses almost explicitly Greek symbols. 
			I had so much fun playing with it.

		<h4> Project Euler </h4>
			When I miss Math, I solve problems on <a href="http://projecteuler.net" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>.I have solved 53 so far. 

		<h4> ACM ICPC </h4>
			Since 2013 I have been participating in Regional ICPC competition. The highest my team has got was 8.

		<h5> Class projects </h5>

		<h4> (YODA)Your Own Digital Accelerator</h4>
			Accelerated MD5 computation on an FPGA.

		<h4> Rubik's Cube Solver </h4>

		<h4> Accela </h4>
